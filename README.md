  - shouldn't take more than one try
  - shouldn't be easy enough to accidentally happen
3. all circuitry, no computer
4. nice case, cool looking design, see requirement 1
5. don't want to mess w/ wall power, use cheap ac/dc

Random notes
============

## Power input

[wall mount adapter](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/tri-mag-llc/L6R24-120/7682639) $6.59
[pair power jack](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/switchcraft-inc/721AFMS/9608573) $6.23 ea

- 12 V Dc for light
- convert that down to 5 V Dc
- How is the power jack so expensive?? I must be missing something.

## Lightbulb

[Lightbulb](^1)
[Lightbulb socket](^2)

- 12V Low Voltage LED Light Bulbs - Warm White 7 Watts

Smth that works off of 12 V and is cheap. This seems fine. Already purchased them, but can't find them!
